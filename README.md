#Problem:


* Small vendors like grocers and vegetable vendors depend on people coming to the store for their clientele.
Such vendors are often ready to deliver at your home, provided you somehow let them know your order.

* A solution is needed to make it easy for people who may not know the vendor's language to order at such
vendors using nothing but natural language SMS, in their own language. The order should reach the vendor
in the vendor's own language too.

#The solution:


The solution consists of -


1. an Android mobile app to be installed on the vendor's phone
2. a light-weight nodejs based server running in the cloud (AWS micro-instance)
3. an optional lamp at the vendorâ€™s place, connected to a smart-switch, for visible and prominent notification of incoming orders.
